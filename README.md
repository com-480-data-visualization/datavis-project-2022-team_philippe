### Dataset

The main data basis of our work will be the "Best Books Ever Dataset". Published in November 2020, it can be found on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/4265096#.Yisi6nrMKUl).

The original data has been collected from [GoodReads - Best Books Ever](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/1.Best_Books_Ever) and contains 25 variables and 52478 records. By default, the dataset contains the following features:

| Attributes  | Definition | Completeness |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | 
| bookId  | Book Identifier as in goodreads.com  | 100% |
| title  | Book title | 100% |
| series | Series Name | 45% |
| author | Book's Author | 100% |
| rating | Global goodreads rating | 100% |
| description | Book's description | 97% |
| language | Book's language | 93% |
| isbn | Book's ISBN | 92% |
| genres | Book's genres | 91% |
| characters | Main characters | 26% |
| bookFormat | Type of binding | 97% |
| edition | Type of edition (ex. Anniversary Edition) | 9% |
| pages | Number of pages | 96% |
| publisher | Editorial | 93% |
| publishDate | publication date | 98% |
| firstPublishDate | Publication date of first edition | 59% |
| awards | List of awards | 20% |
| numRatings | Number of total ratings | 100% |
| ratingsByStars | Number of ratings by stars | 97% |
| likedPercent | Derived field, percent of ratings over 2 starts (as in GoodReads) | 99% |
| setting | Story setting | 22% |
| coverImg | URL to cover image | 99% |
| bbeScore | Score in Best Books Ever list | 100% |
| bbeVotes | Number of votes in Best Books Ever list | 100% |
| price | Book's price (extracted from Iberlibro) | 73% |

After a quick inspection of the data, it seems to be qualitative (low amount of missing data on most important fields, no corrupted data, etc...). It will require some pre-processing
such as filtering non-english books or grouping them by language, **TODO if more**. 

### Problematic

The main aspect we would like to show with our visualization is 


Examples of vues that could bring value to the visualization:
 - 1
 - 2
 - 3
 - etc...

First sktech drawings of what the main pages could look like:

<p align="center">

| Main view | Statistic view | Another view? |
| :---------------: | :--------------------------------------------------: | :------------------------------------------------------: |
| <img src="/Images/random_image.jpeg" width="300" > | <img src="/Images/random_image.jpeg" width="300" > | <img src="/Images/random_image.jpeg" width="300" > |

### Exploratory Data Analysis

One can find the detailed procedure of our Exploratory Data Analysis in the [Jupyter Notebook](/data_processing.ipynb). 

In short, it mainly used Pandas **TODO XYZ, blabla TODO**
